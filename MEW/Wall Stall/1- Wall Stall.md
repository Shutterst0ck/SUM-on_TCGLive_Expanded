Description:

It took me a few days to port over Wall Stall. It seems to "beat everything" except Dragapult Vmax. Part of that is "weird Pokemon + Zacian V" as my start seems to get people into a racing mindset due to all the Zacian ADP, but the win rate is well over 80% against the current random pairings I get. Remember that Wall Stall's worst matchup is random standard decks with energy recursion like Baxcalibur / Dynamotor Flaafy. So far as I can tell, this is the "best deck" simply because folks aren't running appropriate numbers of outs and random Standard decks aren't built to get out of Snorlax 5+ times.

* Core Strategy: is mostly the same as "real" Expanded Wall Stall, except that we don't get ability negation with Wobbuffet. Instead, the strategy is to trap a weak (or incapable) attacker behind Snorlax and/or Galar Mine. There's no Float Stone! For example, Dedenne GX typically cannot attack at all out of Zacian ADP. Even if it does, Enhanced Hammer and Faba will go through their limited supply of special energy quickly. Always go second so you can play Steven's Resolve before they're set up. Almost always get Zacian V out turn 1 and start drawing cards if you can't Steven's Resolve. Quantity is almost as good as quality due to Plumeria. If it costs 3 energy to retreat Dedenne GX, that adds up quickly. The positioning control + energy denial adds up.

* Counterplay: Hold Marnie / Iono / Judge/ Etc for when I Steven's Resolve. If I get it off, you're probably going to lose. You can't blitz me out unless I'm stuck on a terrible opening hand. Radiant Jirachi is always a trap. You're better off not taking that prize card unless it's your last one or you shut it down with Path to the Peak.

* Card-Specific Notes:

  * This is a Galar Mine + Counter Catcher deck. They're both enormous pains to work around since each KO can require a Switch / Guzma / Escape Rope. Make your opponent earn each KO by imposing a cost using these. The power of Lusamine and Cyllene is getting these cards back.

  * Counter Energy is there to get a turn 1 Zacian V. Don't forget that you don't have to get anything at all. If you like your board, but want to attack don't hesitate to fail to find anything.

  * Without Team Flare Grunt, we run two Plumeria. It's a good card, but 3-for-1 doesn't get there without Zacian V fueling it so inconsistent Crushing Hammer has to pick up the slack.

  * Altaria is a one-card out to netdecked Zacian ADP. Unless they have Cancelling Cologne, they can't kill it.

  * Lucario & Melmetal GX is there for its GX attachk, which should almost never be used early. With just Double Colorless Energy, it wipes all the energy off their lead Pokemon and makes an impressive wall. It's best used in most cases to finish the lock by removing all of the energy from their "favorite" attacker in one swoop. With Metal Goggles, it's super tanky to ignore 60 damage each turn, but that's always more fragile than it reads. For that reason, I tend to set up with Penny ready to scoop it safely back into my hand.

  * Sky Pillar isn't quite a one-card answer to Dragapult Vmax, but it's a huge nuisance for both Shadow Rider Calyrex V and Dragapult Vmax since Lusamine makes it so sticky.

  * Mimikyu CEC is often the deck's finisher since getting to play two supporters a turn is so strong. The "Lusamine Loop" means getting to play Faba, Cyllene, or Plumeria every turn! Don't get greedy. I've lost winnable games switching out my own Snorlax because I got impatient.

  * Lillie's Poke Doll doesn't let your opponent take prize cards. Need breathing room? Hide behind one. Why don't I run more Switch Carts? The Doll is a reusable one! Just tuck it and make whatever you want active if you get Escape Roped or something gets KO-d. This is the most frequent way I get Lucario & Melmetal to the front to use its GX attack: bait and switch that works under Galar Mine.

  * Metal Goggles should typically be on Zacian V as early as possible. They usually go for it and you'll have to Penny Zacian anyways.

  * Boost Shake means not having a vulnerable Swablu for a turn before you can have Altaria. In matchups where Swablu / Altaria / Boost Shake don't help, don't hesitate to use Peonia to put them in your prize cards.

  * Radiant Jirachi is the worst card in the deck as the best players know not to KO it just like they know to get and hold a Marnie for your Steven's Resolve. That said, you can still make it stellar by keeping your board lean. If you only have Snorlax and Radiant Jirachi, any Guzma or Escape Rope doesn't actually put them in a better place... It just gets you Galar Mine, Counter Catcher, and a strong supporter.

* As a general note, don't be afraid to take prize cards with Altaria or Mimikyu. Sometimes Counter Catcher is all it takes to let you KO a key Pokemon. You can race, so don't be afraid to!
