Description: 19 energies is a lot! However, you can get it done in two turns thanks to Blastoise's ability to search for up to 6 energies and attach them. For the others, Geeta can help you! Mimikyu serves as stall to pesky V's and ex's, and the other one can disrupt your opponent by stealing their attacks. Because you don't plan to be taking many prize cards with this deck, Iono is the hand refresher of choice. Axew + Thorton is a great combo suggested to me to stop Boss KOs, and once you feel ready to attack, use Counter Catcher to bring out a weak >120 HP Pokemon to the active, then use SUPREME PUFF GX to take another turn and get rid of all of your opponent's benched Pokemon. From there, it's quite simple, just KO the remaining active Pokemon and win!

This is designed to be usable in Live's current expanded format, so suggestions regarding cards from XY and BW won't work here. Thanks!
