# Eternatus Vmax

Description:
• The archetype lost some speed because of no compressor/seeker, so I’m going the other way and am happy to slow things down by running 3 max potions. It’s so OP to pull off one or two max potions in a game

• Some arvens are in there to help facilitate consistent max potions. Also messing around with how it feels as a standalone engine

• I don’t like playing marnie, but with ADP-D/ADP-Z having such a prominent place in the format, and no ranger anymore, your only hope is keeping their hand size low
