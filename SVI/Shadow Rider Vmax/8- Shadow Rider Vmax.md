Description:
• Acerola is so busted in this deck. Effect should read “fully heal your pokemon and draw 4-6 cards”. I have such an evil grin on my face every time I use it.

• Radiant eternatus feels awesome T1 going first and has synergy with 8/12 pokemon search cards

• With forest seal stone now around, adventure bag feels very playable

• I don’t like playing marnie, but with ADP-D/ADP-Z having such a prominent place in the format, and no ranger anymore, your only hope is keeping their hand size low

• I didn’t like the idea of playing a stadium war with a chaotic swell deck, so I pivoted to sudowoodo as an eternatus counter and wondrous lab for adp, eternatus, etc
