# SUM-on_TCGLive_Expanded
This repository aims to manually store public decklists of the SUM-on TCGLive Expanded format.

Many Asian regions such as Taiwan, Singapore or China are only supported after SM, so this repository also works for Expanded format in these regions, called Wild Format. (Note that Wild Format has a different ban list and misses some cards prior to Tag Team area, so Wild decklists might be suboptimal. I won't share Wild decklists with banned cards on TCGLive.)
