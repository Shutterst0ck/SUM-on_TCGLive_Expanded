# SUM-on_TCGLive_Expanded

# I'm stopping updates on this repository, I don't have enough time anymore to search and store decklists, and I didn't find anyone to backup on me.
## If you need more recent decklists, you can try to look at here:
- [pokemoncard.io](https://pokemoncard.io/deck-search/?&_sft_category=expanded) (113 lists stored)
- [Expanded ShowRoom](https://www.youtube.com/@expandedshowroom7547) (102 lists stored)
- [じゅん](https://www.youtube.com/@jun_0712) (54 lists stored)
- [兔子耳朵 Usagi](https://www.youtube.com/@Usagi_Yui) (31 lists stored)
- [MrDogPTCGL](https://www.youtube.com/@mrdogptcgl) (30 lists stored)
- [10types](https://www.youtube.com/@10types) (12 lists stored)

This repository aims to manually store public decklists of the SUM-on TCGLive Expanded format.

Many Asian regions such as Taiwan, Singapore or China are only supported after SM, so this repository also works for Expanded format in these regions, called Wild Format. (Note that Wild Format has a different ban list and misses some cards prior to Tag Team area, so Wild decklists might be suboptimal. I won't share Wild decklists with banned cards on TCGLive.)
