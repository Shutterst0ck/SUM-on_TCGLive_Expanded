Description: This deck takes PRACTICE. Flying Flip in earlier turns while building your hand up with Roxie. Keep track of all damage counters placed, altering them if need be with Hawlucha / Radiant Alakazam. It should not be difficult against low HP basics with Tapu Koko + Roxie + Medicham, with Tapu Lele as a finisher. Against higher HP opponents, KO the first with Sableye V + Counter Energy. Take the next KO with Yveltal's GX attack on an opposing pokemon with 4 damage counters. The last KO can be tricky, depending on if you're ahead on prizes or if your opponent has any low HP basics remaining. Carefully manoeuvre your way to victory with the likes of Echoing Horn / Tapu Lele shenanigans.
