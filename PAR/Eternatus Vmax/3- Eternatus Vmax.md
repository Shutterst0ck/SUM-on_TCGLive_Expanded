Date: December 2023

Description:

Captivate the world, make them knell at your feet with the power of Dark Pulse. Use Hydregion and Galarian Moltres V to get as many energies onto the field, then move them around with Weavile GX. Get as much pokemon on the field to delegate energies with Eternatus Eternamax and Weavile GX. Then coldly take prize by prize with Greninja and Zorarak GX, using Dark Pulse.

An updated version of How The Darkness Stole The World. Using Greninja and Zorarak GX as a better card, as it being a basic and easily gotten through the use of nest ball. Darkrai EX has been taken out from it not being in expanded on TCG Live anymore, so Hiding Darkness Energy and Dark City have replaced it. Not the best replacement, but the most practical use of the situation.
