Description: Morpeko should always be the lead, as its free retreat cost and low Energy attack that also doubles as an acceleration is very useful in getting necesary chip or even early KOs if you aren't charged up enough. Brute Bonnet can Poison the opponent's active Pokemon, which not only assists in extra chip, but enables Darkrai GXs Dead End GX attack to KO said Pokemon. Eternatus VMAX is a great attacker hitting at a max of 270, but also enables the space to have other Pokemon draw cards, such as Crobat V, doing extra chip damage with Brute Bonnet and Radiant Hisuian Sneasler, or charging up Roaring Moon ex with Galarian Moltres V, Darkrai GX, Darkrai ◇, made possible by utilizing Energy Switch and Dark Patch. In addition, Professor Sada's Vitality will also be extra Energy acceleration for Roaring Moon (can also attach to Brute Bonnet and use Energy Switch), but also doubles as decent extra draw. Due to lacking both switch cards and stadiums, Dark City fills both roles as it gives nearly the entire team the ability to retreat freely. Hiding Darkness Energy should be used for Eternatus VMAX as that is the only Pokemon that lacks support from Dark City. Black Market ◇ can be used in the early game in case Morpeko is in the active spot, preventing the opponent from taking any Prize Cards for Morpekos sacrafice.
