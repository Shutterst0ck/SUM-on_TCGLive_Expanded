Date: December 2023

Description: The goal of this deck is to stall your opponent out of the game and make them deck out. Wailord (Silver Tempest) with Buff Padding (Team Up) is effectively a 280hp single prizer. Lillie's Poké Doll (Cosmic Eclipse) is a zero prizer. once your opponent runs out of steam, use Bellelba & Brycen-Man (Cosmic Eclipse) to mill them for 3 every turn or use Miss Fortune Sisters (Lost Origin). Then use Lusamine (Crimson Invasion) to get back whatever supporter and another lusamine for an infinite loop. finally if your active wailord is nearly knocked out, use Max Potion (Guardians Rising) to heal it back to max and not have any drawback.
