Description:

Just trying to save my wip paper build somewhere, feel free to check it out ðŸ˜Ž

I find it ridiculously consistent in my messing around, definitely one of my favorite decks. Roxie is a huge resource with so many pokemon and koff/weez. Inteleon engine pops off at any state of game. Early game quick shooting to fix math makes late game nicer. Purugly is there to help out slow starts or opponents with big beatsticks who won't play along and bench things (echoing horn if they catch on late). Recycle energy and guzma helps stranded pokemon pivot out or with a mew start. Abuse that persian free retreat.

feel free to suggest whatevs

 

some maybe adds:

- More meowth/persian , not having max copies hurts sometimes when you can't find recovery

- telescopic sight , maybe sub out for a stadium or something you aren't finding as much use in those

- extra gust , can be helpful to get some cheeky trappage and snipe out more juicy targets, but generally you don't care about their active

- probably some newer cards from the newer sets , i haven't kept up at all with the new stuff because life
