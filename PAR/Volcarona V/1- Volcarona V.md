Date: 6th December 2023

Description: Using multiple cards to constantly discard Fire Energies, such as Zebstrika (Lost Thunder), Dedenne GX, Ninetales (Team Up), Rapidash (Silver Tempest), Fiery Flint, Heat Factory♦, Kindler, Professors Research, Quick Ball, and Ultra Ball, this will power up Volcaronas Surging Flames attack, while it reshuffles those energies back into the Deck. Rapidash (Silver Tempest) not only discards an extra Energy, but powers up Volcarona by 30+. Ninetales (Team Up) discards two Fire Energies, but also gusts up a benched Pokemon. It may be possible to fit in a few cards such as Basculegion (Lost Origin) or Forest Seal Stone.
