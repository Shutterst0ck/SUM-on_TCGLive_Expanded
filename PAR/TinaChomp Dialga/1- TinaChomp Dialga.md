Description: So, I'm sure you've all seen the classic second turn win deck featuring the convoluted combo revolving around Garchomp & Giratina GX, Dialga VSTAR, Electrode GX, and Scramble Switch. And I'm also sure that you know that with Live's current Expanded format, you can't play Scramble Switch, making the combo impossible. But it's not! With the power of Bronzong and its Metal Transfer ability, you can easily move the attached energy cards around and execute the combo as per usual. (Thank you @StallDecksRule for this!) Unfortunatley, Scramble Switch wasn't thd only thing lost from Live's Expanded format. A ton of powerful draw cards also were lost, so I had to make do here. Suggestions are needed to help boost this deck's consistency. Have fun!
