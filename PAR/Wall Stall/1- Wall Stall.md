Description:

Wall Stall seems to be an S-Tier deck, and almost in a class of its own in terms of win rate. The current build only has bad matchups to off-meta decks whose Plan A involves attaching energy to Pokemon without rule boxes. There might be a meta shift since my last post to energy-heavy decks. So, maybe I'm doing something right :) I'm a terrible Standard player, and I test jank.

* Core Strategy: The decks plays much the same as "real" Expanded Wall Stall, except that we don't get ability negation with Wobbuffet. Instead, the main strategy is to trap a weak (or incapable) attacker behind Snorlax and/or Galar Mine. There's no Float Stone! For example, Dedenne GX typically cannot attack at all out of Zacian ADP. Even if it does, Enhanced Hammer and Faba will go through their limited supply of special energy quickly. Always go second so you can play Steven's Resolve before they're set up. Almost always get Zacian V out turn 1 and start drawing cards if you can't Steven's Resolve. Quantity is almost as good as quality due to Plumeria. If it costs 3 energy to retreat Dedenne GX, that adds up quickly. The positioning control + energy denial adds up. Update: Zacian V started becoming a single point of failure for the deck, so I added coin flip buffs in Blunder Policy, Glimwood Tangle, and Victini. Being able to KO Tag Teams and VMax Pokemon forces your opponent to deal with Jirachi.

* Counterplay: Hold Marnie / Iono / Judge/ Etc for when I Steven's Resolve. If Wall Stall gets 3 three chosen cards, you're probably going to lose. You can't blitz it out unless it's stuck on a terrible opening hand. Radiant Jirachi is always a trap. You're better off not taking that prize card unless it's your last one or you shut it down with Path to the Peak. You should be playing Faba and/or Enhanced Hammer in every deck.

* Card-Specific Notes:
  * This is a Galar Mine + Counter Catcher deck. They're both enormous pains to work around since each KO can require a Switch / Guzma / Escape Rope. Make your opponent earn each KO by imposing a cost using these. The power of Lusamine and Cyllene is getting these cards back.

  * When you can't trap your opponent, this is a Radiant Jirachi deck: put patient opponents on a clock so they don't feel comfortable crafting a hand and setting up their Escape Ropes, Switches, etc. They're playing correctly against the Expanded version, so make their correct play incorrect by taking prize cards before they're set up.

  * Glimwood Tangle and Victini do not stack. With the Lusamine loop, you don't really need Chaotic Swell to keep your opponents' stadiums off the table. Most opponents cannot utilize Glimwood, but it grants you some modest advantage.

  * Capture Energy is there to get an engine up turn 1. Don't forget that you don't have to get anything at all. If you like your board, but want to attack, don't hesitate to fail to find anything.

  * Without Team Flare Grunt, we run two Plumeria. It's a good card, but 3-for-1 doesn't get there without Zacian V fueling it so inconsistent Crushing Hammer has to pick up the slack.

  * Altaria is a one-card out to netdecked Zacian ADP. Unless they have Cancelling Cologne, they can't kill it.

  * Lucario & Melmetal GX is there for its GX attack, which should almost never be used early. With just Double Colorless Energy, it wipes all the energy off their lead Pokemon and makes an impressive wall. It's best used in most cases to finish the lock by removing all of the energy from their "favorite" attacker in one swoop. With Metal Goggles, it's super tanky to ignore 60 damage each turn, but that's always more fragile than it reads. For that reason, I tend to set up with Penny ready to scoop it safely back into my hand.

  * An early Wondrous Labyrinth Prism Star is probably a wasted one.

  * Mimikyu CEC is a back up finisher since getting to play two supporters a turn is so strong. The "Lusamine Loop" means getting to play Faba, Cyllene, or Plumeria every turn! Don't get greedy. I've lost winnable games switching out my own Snorlax because I got impatient.

  * Lillie's Poke Doll doesn't let your opponent take prize cards. Need breathing room? Hide behind one. Why don't I run more Switch Carts? The Doll is a reusable one! Just tuck it and make whatever you want active if you get Escape Roped or something gets KO-d. This is the most frequent way I get Lucario & Melmetal to the front to use its GX attack: bait and switch that works under Galar Mine.

  * Thorton is one of the most important supporters in the deck since it lets you evolve immediately after the swap. Shadow Rider struggles with Mightyena. Even killing one VMax means setting their energy back multiple turns. They can never risk letting you kill a second.

  * Metal Goggles should typically be on Zacian V or Radiant Jirachi as early as possible. They usually go for it and you'll have to Penny Zacian anyways. Read the card twice: it does a lot.

  * Boost Shake means not having a vulnerable Swablu for a turn before you can have Altaria. In matchups where Swablu / Altaria / Boost Shake don't help, don't hesitate to use Peonia to put them in your prize cards. Alolan Persian will eventually be critically important, but I haven't seen any Lugia decks in the wild yet.

  * Girafarig is critical in the mirror since you should expect someone to win by decking. Faba, Cyllene, and Team Yell's Cheer are the primary targets.

  * The worst matchup to a "real" deck was Shadow Rider Calyrex. The 3-card package to Resolve or Jirachi for is Ultra Ball + Thorton + Poochyena. Discard the Pooch to Ultra Ball getting Mightyena. Thorton the Poochyena in as your lead Pokemon, evolve it, and take out their (likely) 3 prize attacker and the three energy on it. To repeat, just Thorton again (Lusamine or other means) and Rescue Stretcher the Mightyena. This matchup is now brutally difficult for them.
