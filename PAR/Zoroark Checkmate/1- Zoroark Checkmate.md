Description: 

Always wanted to make Zoroark checkmate work again, it's still kinda tough with the lack of cards like Sky Field. This is the best rendition I can come up with, though bricky at times, it's hella satisfying when piloted correctly. Always get out Zacian as soon as possible with cards like Capture Energy. This will be your primary form of card draw in early turns, as well as a semi-tank in the active. Do not worry about losing prizes, your opponent can get down to as low as a single prize before you Stinger GX them. This will set both players down to 3 prizes.

Your opponent will most likely KO your Naganadel GX in the following turn, going down to a SINGLE PRIZE. This will be your last hurrah, and you MUST TAKE 3 PRIZES in a single turn and win the game, putting both players in a "checkmate" scenario. You have a couple of options, against a 3 prizer, Garbodor with stadium in play + Alolan Raticate for game. Against a 2 prizer, Garbodor with stadium in play + Alolan Raticate + Jirachi Prism Star (leave a blank space open) for game. Anything else, "Twilight Inspiration" + Jirachi Prism Star for game.

If your opponent refuses to take a KO on your Nagandel GX and thus not going down to a single prize, remove it from play with Giovanni's Exile. Giovanni's Exile is preferred over other cards like Professor Turo's Scenario since it's more flexible in opening up bench slots for Jirachi Prism Star, as well as removing Zacian from play if your opponent bosses around that either. When both Zacian & Naganadel are removed from play, your opponent can only get down to 1 prize and is thus in checkmate once again.

Caitlin is honestly a weird addition, but is my personal take on the best draw support to play. First of, cards like Professor's Research is a no go; there are too many valuable cards to be lost to the discard pile. I do not play Colress's Experiment for the same reason. Shuffle draw supporters like Cynthia are not ideal since I usually have certain pieces I need and am only looking for a couple more. Cards like Zinnia's Resolve and Roxie are good in theory, but often I face difficulty in choosing what to discard. Hence, Caitlin seemed to be my best option. My hand is usually big thanks to Intrepid Sword + Make Do; Caitlin allows me to keep cards I currently need in my hand, putting those I do not need at the moment to the BOTTOM rather than shuffling into the deck, all the while drawing me a couple of cards.

Finally, a few things to take note of. ALWAYS PEONIA AFTER STINGER GX, I cannot emphasise that enough. Your supporter of choice after Stinger GX will typically be reserved for Peonia to send Jirachi Prism Star to the prizes AFTER you shuffle your prizes down to 3. Remember to KEEP YOUR BENCH VACANT enough with cards like Scoop Up Net or Giovanni's Exile so you can actually utilise its ability.

Have fun!
