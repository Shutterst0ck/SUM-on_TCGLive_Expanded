Description:

Use Armarouge, Charizard, Welder, and Kiawe to power up Centiskorch and mill your way to victory!

Start with Battle VIP Pass to get Charmanders and possibly Charcadet. Then evolve and use Welder and Magma Basin to power up a lot. PoGo Charizard is key and Team Up Charizard is important to energy acceleration. Armarouge is to get the energy onto Centiskorch. Once Centiskorch is powered up, mill for game!

Charizard & Braixen-GX is to add consistency with the card search, and can accelerate energy from discard with Crimson Flame Pillar-GX. Ditto is a consistency tool to negate the need for Hisuian Heavy Ball, and can evolve to anything, which is important. Lysandre Prism Star is to mess up whatever your opponent has in discard that they were going to use, but isn't needed and can be replaced.

Have fun with this mill deck!
