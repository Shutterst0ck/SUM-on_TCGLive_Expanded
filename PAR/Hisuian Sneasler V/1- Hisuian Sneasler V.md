Date: 6th December 2023

Description: Sneasler V can hit for 240 if Butterfree (Fusion Strike) evolves that turn, which is very easy as both Caterpie (Rebel Clash) and Metapod (Rebel Clash) have the ability Adaptive Evolution, which allows them to evolve instantly. This number is increased to 270 with the Poison and Burn Damage, and reach 290 if Radiant Sneasler is on the Bench. Paired with Scoop Up Net allows for Butterfree's ability to be recycled as soon as next turn. Crobat V not only serves as a secondary weaker attacker, but is also syngeristic with Radiant Sneasler.
