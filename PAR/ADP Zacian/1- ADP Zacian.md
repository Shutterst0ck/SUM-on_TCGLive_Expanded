Date: 5th December 2023

Description: Generic ADP GX + Zacian V deck. It has Palkia (Celebrations) as an early game lead, in comjuction with Power Plant it can lock your opponent from drawing while allowing you to continue. You could replace Palkia with Mimikyu (Paldea Evolved), Miltank (Astral Radiance), or whatever you feel is needed in replacement. Power Plant could be replaced by Path to the Peak or Chaotic Swell. Marnie could be replaced by Iono. Earthen Vessel could be replaced by Energy Search or even Energy Lotto. Pidgeot V ensures you won't deck out, as that is a possibility. Radiant Greninja not only allows for a bit extra draw, but could even be used to knock out weaker Pokemon. You could possibly fit a Mawile GX, Zacian VSTAR, Marshadow (Unbroken Bonds), Cherish Ball, or Viridian Forest somewhere.
