Date: December 2023

Description: Typical lost box stuff. This deck runs off Colress's Experiment (Lost Origin), and This deck needs to use this card in the first three turns or so to get the lost zone count high. Try to start with Comfey (Lost Origin). Typical turn one is trying to get Cramorant (Lost Origin) to attack for free with its ability after using two flower selecting and a colress's experiment. Then turn two try to get at least 3 more in the lost zone so you can use a mirage gate to swing in with Raikou (Vivid Voltage). Make sure you pay carefull attention to decisions with flower selecting as that can make or break games, especially concerning energies. and good luck!
