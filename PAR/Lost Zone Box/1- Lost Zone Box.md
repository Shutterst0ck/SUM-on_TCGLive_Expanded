Description: Rather straightforward deck, set up Hoppips and get as many pokemon into the Lost Zone as possible for massive damage. Attack in the early turns with Cramorant and utilise the different types to deal super effective damage. The deck can brick quite easily so try to use Oranguru and Colress / Cynthia frequently. Save Lost Blenders to get pokemons into the lost zone; you only get to draw a single card and it is not worth losing trainer cards to the Lost Zone.
