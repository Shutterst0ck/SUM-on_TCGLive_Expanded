Description:

How to play:

* Prefered to go second, as it has a good chance to attack right away

* Boltund V is the best to be active first. Commonly use Electrify as a first attack if you do not have any way to deal damage.

* Use Miraidon to pull a second one (if possible) and a Zeraora. If second Miraidon is pulled, use ability to get a Zekrom&Pikachu and another Boltund.

* For attacking, can alway put a second energy on active Boltund and electric generators on benched Boltund and Zekrom&Pikachu (put wishful baton on the Zekrom&Pikachu because you will want to try and get it to 6 energies). If Zekrom&Pikachu is looking too risky, focus evergies on Boltund. Try to keep as many energies in play as possible to make Boltund VMAX powerful. The Zekrom&Pikachu is mainly for picking off any weak benched enemy mons or getting an easy 17 damage counters on stronger enemy mons.

The rest is prett obvious; use Volk to pull eletric generators (try not to pull energies with him if avoidable, because Zekrom&Pikachu's 150 attack is an easy way to pull 3 energies from your card pile and place on any 1 benched mon and it also gives a higher chance for eletric generator to pull energies). If you're really ahead, you can start loading up Miraidon for a 3 energy 220 attack. Do not put Thunder Mountain in play until you need to use it (if you end up needing it at all). Same for electropowers, save them for when you need a couple more damage counters.
