Date: 5th December 2023

Description: Rowlett & Alolan Exeggutor can be used to have a Tsareena ex by your second turn, which can ensure any Pokemon on your opponent's side has only 30 HP. Pheromosa & Buzzwole GX can use Jet Punch to get 2 KOs at once, or can use Beast Game GX to take an extra Prize Card from one Pokemon. Due to you most likely not taking many KOs in the early game, Beast Bringer can earn an extra Prize Card if you still have 6 remaining. Technical Machine can be used if you are not worried about getting the Tsareena ex, but rather getting Bibarel.
