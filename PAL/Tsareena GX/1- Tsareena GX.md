Date: July 2023

Description:
Idea is to use judge and then Tsareena's gx attack and leave them with 0 cards in hand turn 2. Regular tsareena to accelerate energy celebi and venausaur to attack/recycle all the control cards. trevenant V is another attacker. Other tsareena to discard cards if they get a hand built up.
