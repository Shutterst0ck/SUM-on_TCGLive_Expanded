Description:

This deck is a pretty decent starter if you want to start playing Exp, since it doesn't run any expensive multi-prizers.

Everyone and their Lillipup has taken a stab at Wugtrio mill, but here's my take. On average it can discard more cards than Durant, though it also requires more luck - so play at your own risk.

Wugtrio can discard up to nine cards from your opponent's deck with the right luck - which Victini can aid with by allowing you to re-flip. I think Oranguru is preferable to Bibarel (Brilliant Stars) because it allows more deck space for Trainers, and the benefit over Dedenne-GX is obvious. Phione allows you to mess with your opponent early in the game, acting as a pseudo Boss' Orders before they have any other cards set up. Unlike in Standard, you also aren't completely useless until your opponent has attacked you thanks to Triple Acceleration Energy.

Quick Ball is the most expendable card, you could choose to run something like Pal Pad, Cyllene, or Guzma & Hala instead, though I generally find that having extra Pokemon search is more useful.

In terms of matchups this deck doesn't really excel or struggle in against any one particular popular deck, though cards which can place damage counters can be a major issue since they can KO your low HP basics through Manaphy. Though they aren't unwinnable, the uncommon Dragapult VMAX deck is a little bit more annoying because of this.

As always, any input is appreciated!
