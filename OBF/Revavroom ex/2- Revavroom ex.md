Description:
This is a continuation of me just finding good decks for Live's Expanded with the smaller card pool, and this is one of the coolest decks so far. Revavroom is really good because of things like Metal Saucer, Metal Goggles and Metal Core Barrier. It also has regular Revavroom which allows you to discard Energy for Metal Saucer.

Very quick build but if you have suggestions or cards that I forgot then let me know.
