Description:
This deck is made to use the many different Charizards, like Charizard GX for its 300 damage, or Team Up Charizard to seal a bunch of damage by discarding energy from itself, or Detective Pikachu Charizard GX to deal big damage and discard an energy attached to each of the opponent's Pokémon.

Welder serves as an energy accelerator and has good draw, and Charizard ex is able to hit for dark weakness and for charging up the other Charizards. Pokémon Go Charizard is useful to double energy and be able to have less stress about discarding a ton of energy with your huge attacks.

Reshizard and Radiant Charizard are alternate basic attackers and go with the Charizard theme.

Overall, just a fun buy surprisingly competitive Charizard deck for those who like Charizard, but untested so far so feel free to test it yourself.
