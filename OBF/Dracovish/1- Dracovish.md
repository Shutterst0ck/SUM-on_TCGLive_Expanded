The Dhelmise is always greener, in somebody else's lake~

This deck was somewhat popular back when Dracovish was in Standard, but it recieved a pretty major buff in Pokemon League Headquaters which can majorly slow down basic Pokemon. Dracovish's Primal Law prevents your opponent from evolving, so all of their Pokemon are basic. I'm sure you follow. This list is for LIVE Expanded, though I'm sure it would work in regular Expanded there are a lot more annoying decks that only run basics in that format (i.e. Mewthree and turbo ADP) so we're doing it here instead.

Ideally you'll lead Jirachi, and from there you want to use its ability to get Rare Fossil into play, scoop yourself up and Boost Shake into a Dracovish on turn 1. Your opponent will hopefully draw a big hand through mulligans, which you can capitalize on with Copycat, then Marnie them to slow them down once the fish is out. Obviously this deck matches up extremely well against popular evolution decks like Mew VMAX, but it also does okay against decks like Welder Box. PikaRom decks are going to be very luck dependant, though - ideally Eiscue will allow you to remedy this since that deck is built entirely of Basic Pokemon (unless it's a Flaafy list, I guess).

You could consider running Cram-o-matic or Skyla for more consistent starts, but I find that they become dead cards as the game progresses (and Cram's discard can be potentially detrimental since you really need all of the cards you can get at the start of the game).
